- 1 trap instruction (mnemonic xTRAP) supporting data embedding
---> versatile value specifies the number of bytes of data
---> by convention, zero bytes does not trap; it is a NOP
- 2 unary operator instructions (banks of 8 primitives each, mnemonic rURY)
- 2*10 binary operator instructions (mnemonics rBIN and wBIN)
- 3 sign-extending immediate loading instructions (1-byte, 1-byte plus one negated, and entire-word-load)
---> loading an immediate assigns to both "r" and the referenced stack location (mnemonic cIMM)
- 2 stack adjusting instructions (mnemonic sADJ)
---> versatile value specifies the amount to adjust by (nonzero)
- 1 jump instruction (6 conditions plus always and never)
---> followed by one relative address byte
- 1 invoke instruction (mnemonic iFUN)
---> versatile value specifies the number of relative address bytes
---> currently, only 2 is supported; not 1, not 3
- 1 return instruction (mnemonic iRET)
---> versatile value specifies number of stack values to be popped before the return address
- 1 unused opcode
